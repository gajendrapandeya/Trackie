# Trackie (A run Tracking App):
This app helps people to keep track of a healthy lifestyle by engaging them in physical activities.
The app simply has an option to keep track of your run i.e. how long users have run, how much calories users have burnt, what is the average speed of the run and so on. 
Whenever a user starts his/her run, the app starts tracking user location in the map view and starts drawing Polylines on the map. 
Not only this, the app provides the user to have a look at the statistics of his/her runs. 
User’s total runs are stored in a database which they can observe later.
